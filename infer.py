"""
Typically, the following generation_config performs the best:
- text generation: 
    num_beams=5, do_sample=False, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=1.0, length_penalty=1.0
- image generation: 
    num_beams=5, do_sample=False, repetition_penalty=1.15, temperature=1.0, top_p=0.7, length_penalty=1.0
- tts:
    num_beams=1, do_sample=True, repetition_penalty=1.15, temperature=1.0, top_p=0.7, length_penalty=1.0
- speech generation (not tts):
    num_beams=5, do_sample=False, repetition_penalty=2.0, temperature=1.0, top_p=0.7, length_penalty=1.0
- speech to speech:
    num_beams=5, do_sample=False, repetition_penalty=1.15, temperature=1.0, top_p=0.7, length_penalty=1.0
- video generation: 
    num_beams=1, do_sample=True, repetition_penalty=1.15, temperature=1.0, top_p=0.7, length_penalty=1.0
- multimodal interleaved generation: 
    num_beams=1, do_sample=True, repetition_penalty=1.15, temperature=1.0, top_p=0.7, length_penalty=1.0
    
But you can always try different hyperparameters to see if you can get better results:
- text_generation (image captioning & asr & text-only & others): 
    do_sample=[True, False], repetition_penalty=[1.0, 0.8, 0.9, 1.15, 1.5, 2.0], temperature=[1.0, 0.7, 0.2],
    top_p=[0.7, 0.9, 0.5], length_penalty=[1.0, 1.2, 1.5] 
- image generation & video generation & speech generation:
    num_beams=[1, 5], do_sample=[True, False], repetition_penalty=[1.0, 0.8, 0.9, 1.15, 1.5, 2.0], 
    temperature=[1.0, 0.7, 0.2], top_p=[0.7, 0.9, 0.5], length_penalty=[1.0, 1.2, 1.5]
